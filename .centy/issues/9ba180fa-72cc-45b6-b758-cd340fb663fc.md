# Ignore Tailwind CSS classnames

Currently, the `require-classname` rule treats any value in the `className` attribute as valid. However, when using Tailwind CSS, developers apply utility classes directly (e.g. `className="flex items-center p-4"`) rather than semantic/custom class names.

We should add an option to ignore Tailwind CSS utility classes so they are not counted as valid classnames. This would let teams enforce that elements have meaningful, project-specific class names even when Tailwind utilities are also present.

### Proposed behavior

- Add a new rule option (e.g. `ignoreTailwind: true`) to the `require-classname` rule.
- When enabled, Tailwind CSS utility classes in the `className` attribute are not counted as satisfying the className requirement.
- An element with only Tailwind classes (e.g. `<div className="flex p-4" />`) would still be reported as missing a className.
- An element with both Tailwind and custom classes (e.g. `<div className="flex p-4 my-wrapper" />`) would pass.

### Implementation note

Tailwind class detection should be sourced from an existing npm library rather than maintained manually. We do not want to maintain our own list of Tailwind utility classes — use a third-party package that provides the full set of Tailwind class names and keeps them up to date.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] New `ignoreTailwind` option added to the rule schema
- [ ] Tailwind utility class detection via an external npm package (not a hand-maintained list)
- [ ] Elements with only Tailwind classes are flagged
- [ ] Elements with at least one non-Tailwind class pass
- [ ] Tests covering all scenarios
- [ ] Documentation updated
