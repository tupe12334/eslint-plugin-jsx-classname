# Ignore Tailwind CSS classnames

Currently, the `require-classname` rule treats any value in the `className` attribute as valid. However, when using Tailwind CSS, developers apply utility classes directly (e.g. `className="flex items-center p-4"`) rather than semantic/custom class names.

We should add an option to ignore Tailwind CSS utility classes so they are not counted as valid classnames. This would let teams enforce that elements have meaningful, project-specific class names even when Tailwind utilities are also present.

### Proposed behavior

- Add a new rule option (e.g. `ignoreTailwind: true`) to the `require-classname` rule.
- When enabled, Tailwind CSS utility classes in the `className` attribute are not counted as satisfying the className requirement.
- An element with only Tailwind classes (e.g. `<div className="flex p-4" />`) would still be reported as missing a className.
- An element with both Tailwind and custom classes (e.g. `<div className="flex p-4 my-wrapper" />`) would pass.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] New `ignoreTailwind` option added to the rule schema
- [ ] Tailwind utility class detection (consider using a known prefix list or regex pattern)
- [ ] Elements with only Tailwind classes are flagged
- [ ] Elements with at least one non-Tailwind class pass
- [ ] Tests covering all scenarios
- [ ] Documentation updated
